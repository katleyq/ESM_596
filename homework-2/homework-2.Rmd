## Linear Regression and KNN

For this assignment, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](images/17612037-abalone-shell-inside.jpg){width="309"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

```{r message=FALSE}
# Load relevant libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(here)
library(gt)

# Load abalone data
abalone <- read_csv(here("homework-2/data/abalone.csv"))
```

```{r}
# List first column names and first two observations of dataframe 
head(abalone, 2) %>% 
  gt()
```

### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

```{r}
# Create new column in abalone dataset named "age" and calculate it by adding 1.5 to ring column
abalone <- abalone %>% 
  mutate(age = rings + 1.5)

# Verify column
head(abalone, 2) %>% 
  gt()
```

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.

```{r}
# Create a histogram of age
ggplot(abalone, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "navy", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Frequency", title = "Histogram of Age in Abalone Dataset") +
  theme_minimal()
```

> The histogram above shows that the age variable is unimodal and right-skewed. It's not completely clear though so we can assess skewness by comparing the mean and median as a test. The test below confirms that it is right-skewed.

```{r}
# Print mean value
print(paste("Mean:", mean(abalone$age)))

# Print median value
print(paste("Median:", median(abalone$age)))


```

### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

> First, we'll need to figure out which variable to stratify by.

```{r}
# Reformat variables as characters for processing then reeshape the data to long format
abalone_long <- abalone %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value")

# Create facet histogram plots with a conditional check for numeric and categorical variables
ggplot(abalone_long, aes(x = Value)) +
  # Filter variables for numeric data types for plotting
  geom_histogram(data = subset(abalone_long, sapply(Value, is.numeric)),
                 bins = 30, fill = "navy", color = "black") +
  # Filter variables for categorical data types for plotting
  geom_bar(data = subset(abalone_long, !sapply(Value, is.numeric)), 
           fill = "navy", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ Variable, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Histograms/Bar Charts of Variables in Abalone Dataset", 
       x = "Value", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility purposes
set.seed(123)

# Split the data with stratified sampling
split <- initial_split(abalone, prop = 0.75, strata = age)

# Subset training set
abalone_train <- training(split)

# Subset testing set
abalone_test <- testing(split)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you **should not** include `rings` to predict `age`. *Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.*

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors

2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

```{r}

```

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

### Question 5

Create and store a KNN object using the `"kknn"` engine. Specify `k = 7`.

### Question 6

Now, for each of these models (linear regression and KNN):

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

Note that you should be setting up two separate workflows.

Fit both models to the training set.

### Question 7

Use your linear regression `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, and shell_weight = 1.

### Question 8

Now you want to assess your models' performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `augment()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **testing data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R\^2* value.

Repeat these steps once for the linear regression model and for the KNN model.

### Question 9

Which model performed better on the testing data? Explain why you think this might be. Are you surprised by any of your results? Why or why not?

### Required for 231 Students

In lecture, we presented the general bias-variance tradeoff equation, which takes the form:

$$
E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2]=Var(\hat{f}(x_0))+[Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2+Var(\epsilon)
$$

where the underlying model $Y=f(X)+\epsilon$ satisfies the following:

-   $\epsilon$ is a zero-mean random noise term and $X$ is non-random (all randomness in $Y$ comes from $\epsilon$);
-   $(x_0, y_0)$ represents a test observation, independent of the training set, drawn from the same model;
-   $\hat{f}(.)$ is the estimate of $f$ obtained from the training set.

#### Question 10

Which term(s) in the bias-variance tradeoff above represent the reducible error? Which term(s) represent the irreducible error?

#### Question 11

Using the bias-variance tradeoff above, demonstrate that the expected test error is equal to the irreducible error if $\hat{f}(x_0) = E(y_0|x_0)$

#### Question 12

Prove the bias-variance tradeoff equation.
